# Progress Log

## Learnings
(Notes discovered during implementation)

## Decisions
- PRD rewritten from scratch with expanded scope: price + sentiment + fundamentals data sources
- Story IDs reset to US-001..US-703 (no phase prefix in Phase 0, phase-prefixed from Phase 1 onward)
- ML retraining is core to the system (Phase 5), not optional

## Integration Notes
(Cross-story dependencies and gotchas)

## Next Smallest Task
- US-001: Create project skeleton (Phase 0 begins)
